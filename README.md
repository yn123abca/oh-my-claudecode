## Quick Start

**Step 1: Install**

Marketplace/plugin install (recommended for most Claude Code users).
These are Claude Code slash commands — enter them **one at a time** (pasting both lines at once will fail):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode
```

Then:

```bash
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

If you prefer the npm CLI/runtime path instead of the marketplace flow:

```bash
npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest
```

> **Known npm warning:** npm may print `deprecated prebuild-install@7.1.3` during the CLI install.
> This currently comes from the upstream `better-sqlite3` native-addon dependency
> (`better-sqlite3 -> prebuild-install`); `prebuild-install@7.1.3` is still the latest
> published version, so there is no safe repo-side dependency bump or override to remove
> the warning yet. The warning is tracked in [#2913](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/issues/2913)
> and does not by itself mean the OMC CLI install failed.

**Step 2: Setup**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / OMC session
/setup
/omc-setup

# From your terminal
omc setup
```

If you run OMC via `omc --plugin-dir <path>` or `claude --plugin-dir <path>`, add `--plugin-dir-mode` to `omc setup` (or export `OMC_PLUGIN_ROOT` before running it) so the installer doesn't duplicate skills/agents that the plugin already provides at runtime. See the [Plugin directory flags section in REFERENCE.md](./docs/REFERENCE.md#plugin-directory-flags) for a complete decision matrix and all available flags.

**Step 3: Build something**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code / OMC session
/autopilot "build a REST API for managing tasks"

# Natural-language in-session shortcut
autopilot: build a REST API for managing tasks
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

### CLI Commands vs In-Session Skills

OMC exposes two different surfaces:

- **Terminal CLI commands**: run `omc ...` from your shell after installing the npm/runtime path (`npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest`) or from a local checkout.
- **In-session skills**: run `/...` inside a Claude Code session after installing the plugin/setup flow.

| Feature | Terminal CLI | In-session skill | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | `omc setup` | `/setup` or `/omc-setup` | Both are real entrypoints. `/setup` is the easiest plugin-first path. |
| Ask providers | `omc ask codex "review this patch"` | `/ask codex "review this patch"` | Both route through the same advisor flow. |
| Team orchestration | `omc team 2:codex "review auth flow"` | `/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"` | Both exist, but they are different runtimes: `omc team` launches tmux CLI workers; `/team` runs the in-session native team workflow. |
| Autopilot / Ralph / Ultrawork / Deep Interview | — | `/autopilot ...`, `/ralph ...`, `/ultrawork ...`, `/deep-interview ...` | These are in-session skills. There is no `omc autopilot` / `omc ralph` / `omc ultrawork` CLI subcommand in this repo. |
| Autoresearch | `omc autoresearch` (**hard-deprecated shim**) | `/deep-interview --autoresearch ...` + `/oh-my-claudecode:autoresearch` | Setup stays in deep-interview; execution now belongs to the stateful skill. |

### Not Sure Where to Start?

If you're uncertain about requirements, have a vague idea, or want to micromanage the design:

```
/deep-interview "I want to build a task management app"
```

The deep interview uses Socratic questioning to clarify your thinking before any code is written. It exposes hidden assumptions and measures clarity across weighted dimensions, ensuring you know exactly what to build before execution begins.

## Team Mode (Recommended)

Starting in **v4.1.7**, **Team** is the canonical orchestration surface in OMC. The legacy `swarm` keyword/skill has been removed; use `team` directly.

```bash
/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

Use `/team ...` when you want Claude Code's in-session native team workflow. Use `omc team ...` when you want terminal-launched tmux CLI workers (`claude` / `codex` / `gemini` panes).

Team runs as a staged pipeline:

`team-plan → team-prd → team-exec → team-verify → team-fix (loop)`

Enable Claude Code native teams in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

> If teams are disabled, OMC will warn you and fall back to non-team execution where possible.

### tmux CLI Workers — Codex & Gemini (v4.4.0+)

**v4.4.0 removes the Codex/Gemini MCP servers** (`x`, `g` providers). Use the CLI-first Team runtime (`omc team ...`) to spawn real tmux worker panes:

```bash
omc team 2:codex "review auth module for security issues"
omc team 2:gemini "redesign UI components for accessibility"
omc team 1:claude "implement the payment flow"
omc team status auth-review
omc team shutdown auth-review
```

`/omc-teams` remains as a legacy compatibility skill and now routes to `omc team ...`.

For mixed Codex + Gemini work in one command, use the **`/ccg`** skill (routes via `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini`, then Claude synthesizes):

```bash
/ccg Review this PR — architecture (Codex) and UI components (Gemini)
```

| Surface                   | Workers            | Best For                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `omc team N:codex "..."`  | N Codex CLI panes  | Code review, security analysis, architecture |
| `omc team N:gemini "..."` | N Gemini CLI panes | UI/UX design, docs, large-context tasks      |
| `omc team N:claude "..."` | N Claude CLI panes | General tasks via Claude CLI in tmux         |
| `/ccg`                    | /ask codex + /ask gemini | Tri-model advisor synthesis           |

Workers spawn on-demand and die when their task completes — no idle resource usage. Requires `codex` / `gemini` CLIs installed and an active tmux session.

Native team worker worktrees are being added behind an opt-in/config gate. See [Native Team Worktree Mode](docs/TEAM-WORKTREE-MODE.md) for the workspace contract, canonical state-root rules, dirty-worktree preservation policy, and verification checklist.

> **Note: Package naming** — The project is branded as **oh-my-claudecode** (repo, plugin, commands), but the npm package is published as [`oh-my-claude-sisyphus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oh-my-claude-sisyphus). If you install or upgrade the CLI tools via npm/bun, use `npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest`.

### Updating

If you installed OMC via npm, upgrade with the published package name:

```bash
npm i -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@latest
```

> **Package naming note:** the repo, plugin, and commands are branded **oh-my-claudecode**, but the published npm package name remains `oh-my-claude-sisyphus`.

If you installed OMC via the Claude Code marketplace/plugin flow, update with:

```bash
# 1. Update the marketplace clone
/plugin marketplace update omc

# 2. Re-run setup to refresh configuration
/setup
```

If you are developing from a local checkout or git worktree, update the checkout first, then re-run setup from that worktree so the active runtime matches the code you are testing.

> **Note:** If marketplace auto-update is not enabled, you must manually run `/plugin marketplace update omc` to sync the latest version before running setup.

If you experience issues after updating, clear the old plugin cache:

```bash
/omc-doctor
```

## Features

### Orchestration Modes

Multiple strategies for different use cases — from Team-backed orchestration to token-efficient refactoring. [Learn more →](https://yeachan-heo.github.io/oh-my-claudecode-website/docs/#execution-modes)

| Mode                    | What it is                                                                              | Use For                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team (recommended)**  | Canonical staged pipeline (`team-plan → team-prd → team-exec → team-verify → team-fix`) | Coordinated Claude agents on a shared task list        |
| **omc team (CLI)**      | tmux CLI workers — real `claude`/`codex`/`gemini` processes in split-panes              | Codex/Gemini CLI tasks; on-demand spawn, die when done |
| **ccg**                 | Tri-model advisors via `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini`, Claude synthesizes                   | Mixed backend+UI work needing both Codex and Gemini    |
| **Autopilot**           | Autonomous execution (single lead agent)                                                | End-to-end feature work with minimal ceremony          |
| **Ultrawork**           | Maximum parallelism (non-team)                                                          | Burst parallel fixes/refactors where Team isn't needed |
| **Ralph**               | Persistent mode with verify/fix loops                                                   | Tasks that must complete fully (no silent partials)    |
| **Pipeline**            | Sequential, staged processing                                                           | Multi-step transformations with strict ordering        |
| **Ultrapilot (legacy)** | Deprecated compatibility mode (autopilot pipeline alias)                                | Existing workflows and older docs                      |

### Intelligent Orchestration

- **19 specialized agents** (with tier variants) for architecture, research, design, testing, data science
- **Smart model routing** - Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex reasoning
- **Automatic delegation** - Right agent for the job, every time

### Developer Experience

- **Magic keywords** - non-runtime workflow keywords still route automatically; runtime workflows such as `ralph`, `autopilot`, and `ultrawork` now require explicit `/...` invocation or explicit `omc` runtime intent. Team stays explicit via `/team`
- **HUD statusline** - Real-time orchestration metrics in your status bar
  - If you launch Claude Code directly with `claude --plugin-dir <path>` (bypassing the `omc` shim), export `OMC_PLUGIN_ROOT=<path>` in your shell so the HUD bundle resolves to the same checkout as the plugin loader. See the [Plugin directory flags section in REFERENCE.md](./docs/REFERENCE.md#plugin-directory-flags) for details.
- **Skill learning** - Extract reusable patterns from your sessions
- **Analytics & cost tracking** - Understand token usage across all sessions

### Contributing

Want to contribute to OMC? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full developer guide, including how to fork, set up a local checkout, link it as your active plugin, run tests, and submit PRs.

### Custom Skills

Learn once, reuse forever. OMC extracts hard-won debugging knowledge into portable skill files that auto-inject when relevant.

| | Project Scope | User Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Path** | `.omc/skills/` | `~/.omc/skills/` |
| **Shared with** | Team (commit the skill file to keep it across worktrees) | All your projects |
| **Priority** | Higher (overrides user) | Lower (fallback) |

```yaml
# .omc/skills/fix-proxy-crash.md
---
name: Fix Proxy Crash
description: aiohttp proxy crashes on ClientDisconnectedError
triggers: ["proxy", "aiohttp", "disconnected"]
source: extracted
---
Wrap handler at server.py:42 in try/except ClientDisconnectedError...
```

**Manage skills:** `/skill list | add | remove | edit | search`
**Skillify:** `/skillify` extracts reusable patterns with strict quality gates
**Auto-inject:** Matching skills load into context automatically — no manual recall needed

Project-scoped skills are stored in `.omc/skills/` and are intended to be committed when you want them shared. If you create them inside a linked git worktree and do not commit them, they disappear when that worktree is removed.

## In-session shortcuts

These shortcuts run **inside a Claude Code / OMC session**, not as terminal CLI commands. For shell commands, use the `omc ...` forms shown above. Team mode is explicit: use `/team ...` in-session or `omc team ...` from your shell rather than expecting a bare `team` keyword trigger.

| In-session form        | Kind                  | Effect                              | Example                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/team`                | Slash skill           | Canonical Team orchestration        | `/team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"` |
| `/ccg`                 | Slash skill           | `/ask codex` + `/ask gemini` synthesis | `/ccg review this PR`                       |
| `/autopilot` | Slash/runtime invocation | Full autonomous execution       | `/autopilot "build a todo app"`                |
| `/ralph`     | Slash/runtime invocation | Persistence mode                   | `/ralph "refactor auth"`                       |
| `/ultrawork` | Slash/runtime invocation | Maximum parallelism                | `/ultrawork "fix all errors"`                  |
| `/ralplan` / `ralplan` | Skill / prompt trigger | Iterative planning consensus       | `/ralplan "plan this feature"`                 |
| `/deep-interview`      | Slash skill           | Socratic requirements clarification | `/deep-interview "vague idea"`                 |
| `deepsearch`           | Prompt trigger        | Codebase-focused search routing     | `deepsearch for auth middleware`               |
| `ultrathink`           | Prompt trigger        | Deep reasoning mode                 | `ultrathink about this architecture`           |
| `cancelomc`, `stopomc` | Prompt trigger        | Stop active OMC modes               | `stopomc`                                      |

**Notes:**

- **ralph includes ultrawork**: when you activate ralph mode, it automatically includes ultrawork's parallel execution.
- `swarm` compatibility alias has been removed; migrate existing prompts to `/team` syntax.
- `plan this` / `plan the` keyword triggers were removed; use `ralplan` or explicit `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-plan`.
- quick, standard, and deep all default to direct execution. Deep classification alone does not start OMC.
- Runtime workflows start only when you explicitly invoke `/...`, `/oh-my-claudecode:...`, `omc ...`, or otherwise explicitly ask to use OMC runtime.

## Utilities

### Provider Advisor (`omc ask` / `/ask`)

Run local provider CLIs and save a markdown artifact under `.omc/artifacts/ask/`.

```bash
# Terminal CLI
omc ask claude "review this migration plan"
omc ask codex --prompt "identify architecture risks"
omc ask gemini --prompt "propose UI polish ideas"
omc ask claude --agent-prompt executor --prompt "draft implementation steps"

# Inside a Claude Code / OMC session
/ask claude "review this migration plan"
/ask codex "identify architecture risks"
```

Canonical env vars:

- `OMC_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT`
- `OMC_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK`

Phase-1 aliases `OMX_ASK_ADVISOR_SCRIPT` and `OMX_ASK_ORIGINAL_TASK` are accepted with deprecation warnings.

### Autoresearch (stateful skill)

`omc autoresearch` is now a **hard-deprecated shim**. The authoritative workflow is:

```bash
/deep-interview --autoresearch improve startup performance
/oh-my-claudecode:autoresearch
```

- `deep-interview --autoresearch` generates/sets up the mission and evaluator
- `autoresearch` runs the bounded, single-mission stateful loop
- each iteration records evaluation JSON plus markdown decision logs
- non-passing iterations continue
- strict stopping is controlled by an explicit max-runtime ceiling

### Rate Limit Wait

Auto-resume Claude Code sessions when rate limits reset.

```bash
omc wait          # Check status, get guidance
omc wait --start  # Enable auto-resume daemon
omc wait --stop   # Disable daemon
```

**Requires:** tmux (for session detection)

### Monitoring & Observability

Use the HUD for live observability and the current session/replay artifacts for post-session inspection:

- HUD preset: `/oh-my-claudecode:hud setup` then use a supported preset such as `"omcHud": { "preset": "focused" }`
- Session summaries: `.omc/sessions/*.json`
- Replay logs: `.omc/state/agent-replay-*.jsonl`
- Live HUD rendering: `omc hud`

### Notification Tags (Telegram/Discord/Slack)

You can configure who gets tagged when stop callbacks send session summaries.

```bash
# Set/replace tag list
omc config-stop-callback telegram --enable --token <bot_token> --chat <chat_id> --tag-list "@alice,bob"
omc config-stop-callback discord --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "@here,123456789012345678,role:987654321098765432"
omc config-stop-callback slack --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "<!here>,<@U1234567890>"

# Incremental updates
omc config-stop-callback telegram --add-tag charlie
omc config-stop-callback discord --remove-tag @here
omc config-stop-callback discord --clear-tags
```

Tag behavior:

- Telegram: `alice` becomes `@alice`
- Discord: supports `@here`, `@everyone`, numeric user IDs, and `role:<id>`
- Slack: supports `<@MEMBER_ID>`, `<!channel>`, `<!here>`, `<!everyone>`, `<!subteam^GROUP_ID>`
- `file` callbacks ignore tag options

### OpenClaw Integration

Forward Claude Code session events to an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) gateway to enable automated responses and workflows via your OpenClaw agent.

**Quick setup (recommended):**

```bash
/oh-my-claudecode:configure-notifications
# → When prompted, type "openclaw" → choose "OpenClaw Gateway"
```

**Manual setup:** create `~/.claude/omc_config.openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "gateways": {
    "my-gateway": {
      "url": "https://your-gateway.example.com/wake",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" },
      "method": "POST",
      "timeout": 10000
    }
  },
  "hooks": {
    "session-start": { "gateway": "my-gateway", "instruction": "Session started for {{projectName}}", "enabled": true },
    "stop":          { "gateway": "my-gateway", "instruction": "Session stopping for {{projectName}}", "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OMC_OPENCLAW=1` | Enable OpenClaw |
| `OMC_OPENCLAW_DEBUG=1` | Enable debug logging |
| `OMC_OPENCLAW_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json` | Override config file path |

**Supported hook events (6 active in bridge.ts):**

| Event | Trigger | Key template variables |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `session-start` | Session begins | `{{sessionId}}`, `{{projectName}}`, `{{projectPath}}` |
| `stop` | Claude response completes | `{{sessionId}}`, `{{projectName}}` |
| `keyword-detector` | Every prompt submission | `{{prompt}}`, `{{sessionId}}` |
| `ask-user-question` | Claude requests user input | `{{question}}`, `{{sessionId}}` |
| `pre-tool-use` | Before tool invocation (high frequency) | `{{toolName}}`, `{{sessionId}}` |
| `post-tool-use` | After tool invocation (high frequency) | `{{toolName}}`, `{{sessionId}}` |

**Reply channel environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_CHANNEL` | Reply channel (e.g. `discord`) |
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_TARGET` | Channel ID |
| `OPENCLAW_REPLY_THREAD` | Thread ID |

See `scripts/openclaw-gateway-demo.mjs` for a reference gateway that relays OpenClaw payloads to Discord via ClawdBot.

### Platform & tmux

OMC features like `omc team` and rate-limit detection require **tmux**:

| Platform       | tmux provider                                            | Install                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |

### Optional: Multi-AI Orchestration

OMC can optionally orchestrate external AI providers for cross-validation and design consistency. These are **not required** — OMC works fully without them.

| Provider                                                  | Install                             | What it enables                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | Design review, UI consistency (1M token context) |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)              | `npm install -g @openai/codex`      | Architecture validation, code review cross-check |

**Cost:** 3 Pro plans (Claude + Gemini + ChatGPT) cover everything for ~$60/month.
